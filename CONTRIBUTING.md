# Contributing

## Contribution Scope
Contributions should improve reproducibility, safety, and clarity of the pipeline.

## Rules
1. Do not weaken gating behavior (validation-before-drafting).
2. Do not remove required artifact fields without migration notes.
3. Keep source-of-truth hierarchy intact.
4. Include update notes in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Pull Request Checklist
- [ ] Updated docs where behavior changed
- [ ] Added/updated migration notes if schema changed
- [ ] Added/updated validation checks
- [ ] No credentials or private manuscript content committed
